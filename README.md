Hi!

Iâ€™m currently working on various projects, challenges and concepts that I want to explore or dig into!
Things that I am currently showing publicly are: libraries, visualisation tool(s), command line tool(s) and containerised service(s). Along with lots more privately!

I enjoy learning new skills and diversifying my knowledge by working through new problems that I can then apply to solve future challenges!

Thanks for checking out my profile!
