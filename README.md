## Hi, I'm Kyle ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various projects and concepts that I want to explore or dig into! Things that I am currently showing publicly are: libraries, visualisation tool(s), command line tool(s) and containerised service(s)!

- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about testing (unit testing, integration and end to end testing), Kotlin, C++ and Go!

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new skills in areas that help to diversify my knowledge base so I can further take on and solve new challenges!
